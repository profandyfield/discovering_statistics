## Overview



The Wilcoxon signed-rank test is a non-parametric test that looks for differences between two dependent samples. That is, it tests whether the populations from which two related samples are drawn have the same location. It is the non-parametric equivalents of the dependent (or matched-pairs) *t*-test.
