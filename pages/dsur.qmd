## The second edition

The [first edition of this book](https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/discovering-statistics-using-r/book236067) is now quite out of date. The good news is that I'\ve been working on an update for the past 4+ years! I hope to finish it soon.

In the meantime, I have written a package of R tutorials [the discovr package](https://discovr.rocks/discover) that contains a lot of the new material, and you can find out about the new edition at the [companion website](https://discovr.rocks/).
