## Overview


The Mann–Whitney test is a non-parametric test that looks for differences between two independent samples. That is, it tests whether the populations from which two samples are drawn have the same location. It is functionally the same as Wilcoxon’s rank-sum test, and both tests are non-parametric equivalents of the independent *t*-test.

This test has been superseded by developments in robust statistical tests. It’s included here for historical reasons.
