## Overview


[JASP](https://jasp-stats.org) is a free, open-source, cross-platform package for statistical analysis developed at the University of Amsterdam (thanks to funding from the ERC grant *Bayes or Bust!* from the European Union). Compared to R, it is more user-friendly in that it offers a nice user-interface and real-time updating of output. Compared to SPSS, it's focus on certain procedures makes it a bit less bewildering and it does Bayesian statistics as well as the classical tests that you are currently being taught, which trust me will be a major selling point in the not too distant future.
