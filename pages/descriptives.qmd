## Overview


This tutorial is a bit lacking at present! It will, in time (maybe), look at how to summarize data using measures of central tendency such as the mean, mode and median, and measures of dispersion such as variance, standard deviation and standard error. It will also look at confidence intervals. My books cover all of these topics beautifully by the way;-)
